Data Cleansing is an important process involved in preparing data for analytics. It helps in increasing efficiency and productivity by improving the quality of data. In this assignment, we will try to cover the basics of data cleansing which will give you a better understanding of the topic.


With reference to the given IPL 2021 dataset (ipl2021dirtydataset.csv) in the folder, answer the following questions:  

    (i) In general, explain the common sources of error that can be found in data.
    (ii) Which of the columns do you think are of no use? Remove those irrelevant observations.
    (iii) Why do you think duplicate values need to be removed while cleansing the dataset? How would you achieve the same?
    (iv) Using isnull() and isna() functions, check if any null values are present in the dataset. Is there any difference between the 2 functions?
    (v) Explain the different ways of handling missing data. Suggest the pros and cons of each method by giving a suitable example for the same.
    (vi) Which method would you use to handle the missing data in this case and why? 
    (vii) Fill the missing data in the given dataset without deleting any columns or rows.
    (viii) Fix the structural errors in the given dataset, for example you may find 'NA' and 'Not Applicable' being used interchangeably and similarly abbreviations have also been used for the team names in some places 
    (ix) How do you detect outliers? Filter out unwanted outliers in the dataset (hint: you can also use the help of plots to figure this out)
