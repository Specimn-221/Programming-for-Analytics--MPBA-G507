#FUNCTIONS

NOTE: The challenges are just added to make the assignments fun and ensure that the students understand how programming is actually done. Reading the documentation and working your way through the problems with the help of resources online will ensure a better learning experience.

## Basic 

1. Write a function that takes two numbers, a and b, as arguments, and returns a raised to the power b.

    + Challenge 1: Try to generate the numbers a and b randomly in the range of 1 to 10 as part of the function. (Clue: Google - `sample` function)
    + Challenge 2: Initialize the number a as a vector and try to return a vector with each element of a raised to the number b.
    
 
2. Write a function that takes a number as argument and returns true if it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and false otherwise.
    
    + Challenge: Randomize the number that needs to be given as an argument to the function in the range from 1 to 1000.
 
3. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer as its argument and returns its factorial.

    + Challenge: Do not use the built-in function factorial()
    

## Might be bit of a challenge.

4. Write a function to compute the dot product of two vectors.
    
    + Challenge 1: Do not use in-built R functions.(Clue: Iterative algorithm)
    + Challenge 2: Vectors should be of arbitrary length.
    
5. Write a function that takes a numeric vector and prints on screen the mean and standard deviation.
  
    + Challenge: Do not use in-built R functions.

6. Write a function given that takes a vector as its argument and returns a new vector with the elements of the first vector with duplicated elements removed.   
    
    + HINT: Iterate through the vector checking for duplicate elements.

  

## Will require some thorough reading.

7. Write a function to find out the factors of a positive integer. 
    
    + Challenge: Find 2 different solutions. 
    + HINT (For 1st solution): Look up the R documentation for functions such as `lapply`
    + HINT (For 2nd solution): `Vectorize` and `Filter` functions may be of some help.

8. Write a function that prints out the value of the Ackermann Function after entering two numbers as input. (Picked up this problem because it reminds me of 'Attack on Titan', PS: It's an anime!)   
  
    + This problem will introduce you to the concept of recursive functions. (Definitely, do a Google Search on recursive functions!) An image describing the Ackermann Function has been given below.

    + Hint: Problem requires use of if-else statements.
    
    + No challenges have been provided for this problem, as the problem is a challenge in itself. :)
