# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with matrices, vectors and vector spaces, and systems of linear equations.

**NOTE:**

    1) Each variable in each code chunk is being used in latter code chunks. That is, the code has been written such that each variable is a global variable. (Google global variables if you are confused!)

    2) Try running each code chunk by yourself and observe the code chunk variables in the global environment of R. Or make an R Script of your own and type the code out (Best Practice!).
    
    
### Vectors

Vectors are defined as an ordered collection of numbers. We use the concatenate function `c()` to create  a vector with a certain amount of elements or use the `assign()` function.

```{r}

my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)

assign('my_vector', c(1, 2, 3, 4))

```

The `<-` can be interchanged with the `=` operator. 

There are various ways one can generate sequences of numbers in a vector. We can use the `seq()` function and also the `:` operator. The `rep()` function can be used to replicate vectors.

```{r}

# The below line prints a vector with numbers between and including 1 and 10.
colon = c(1:10)

# Returns the same output as above.
sequence = seq(1,10)

# Increments can be given as part of the 'by' attribute in the sequence function.
sequence_2 = seq(1,20, by = 2.0)

# The times attribute is used to specify the number of times the vector must be replicated.
repetition = rep(colon, times = 5)


```

**TO-DO** 

Figure out what the lines in the below code chunk would give as the output. (Or you could just run it, but that would be cheating!)

```{r}

my_vector_test <- c(my_vector, 0 , my_vector)

#Hint for the below problem: Operator Precedence.
colon_test <- c(2*1:5)

```

##### Vector Operations

The arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^` can all be used for vector operations. `log`, `exp`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`, and more can also be used. 

`max` and `min` functions return the largest and smallest elements of a vector, and `length` function returns the number of elements in the vector.The `sum` gives the total of the elements in the vector, and `prod` their product.

**TO-DO** 

    1) Try using the above operators and functions and test it out on the `my_vector` variable. Also, try using the arithmetic operators between i) `my_vector` and itself, ii) `my_vector` and `my_vector_test`. (How are the arithmetic operators working on vectors of different length!)
    
    2) Use the R Documentation and find out uses for `mean()`, `var()` functions. Apply them to the vectors we have declared above. 
    
    
### Matrices and Arrays

Matrices are a very natural approach of organizing the data.(**2-dimensional array**) Usually matrices are used to store and represent the data on machines.

In general, data is organized in the following fashion:
        
        1) Rows represent the samples.
        2) Columns represent the values of the variables(attributes).
        
In the below code chunk, we try to find out a way to initialize a matrix. 
        
```{r}

#Figure out what the attributes 4, 6 are in the matrix() function        
matrix_1 <- matrix(c(1:24), 4, 6)

print(matrix_1)

#We have seen something similar to the output of the lines below when we were initializing vectors.
matrix_2 = matrix(c(2, 4, 6), 3, 3)

print(matrix_2)
```
        
An array is a subscripted collection of data entries, not necessarily numeric. Arrays are the R data objects which can store data in more than two dimensions.

For example − If we create an array of dimension `(3, 3, 5)` then it creates 5 rectangular matrices each with 3 rows and 3 columns. Arrays can store only one data type.

An array is created using the `array()` function. It takes vectors as input and uses the values in the `dim` attribute to create an array. 

Let us try and run the code chunk below! Try to deduce the output of the code chunk before running the code chunk.


```{r}

# Create two vectors of different lengths.
vector_even <- c(2, 4, 6)
vector_odd <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)

# Giving names to the column, rows and matrices. (Basically naming each dimension!)
column.names <- c("COL1","COL2","COL3")
row.names <- c("ROW1","ROW2","ROW3")
matrix.names <- c("Matrix 1","Matrix 2")

# Take these vectors as input to the array.
array_final <- array(c(vector_even,vector_odd),dim = c(3,3,2),dimnames = list(row.names,column.names,
   matrix.names))

print(array_final)


```

##### Accessing and Manipulating Array Elements

In this topic, we shall directly move to the *TO-DOs* as the title clearly suggests what we shall be doing.

**TO-DO:**

    1) Run both the given code chunks and try to deduce what the outputs are. Some help has been provided in the comments.
    
    2) Try to obtain the entire 1st matrix in the array `array_final` with all the rows but only the first 2 columns. (Hint: `:` might be of some use)


```{r}

# Prints the third row of the second matrix of the array.
print(array_final[3,,2])

# Prints the element in the 1st row and 3rd column of the 1st matrix.
print(array_final[1,3,1])

# Prints the 2nd Matrix.
print(array_final[,,2])


```

    3) Work on completely randomizing the vectors given below in the code chunk without substituting values by yourself. (Hint: We have done this before!)

```{r}

# Create two vectors of different lengths.
vector_random_1 <- c(9,1,0)
vector_random_2 <- c(6,0,11,3,14,1,2,6,9)

#Create an array from these vectors.
array_random <- array(c(vector_random_1,vector_random_2),dim = c(3,3,2))

# create matrices from array_final and array_random.
matrix_random_1 <- array_random[,,2]
matrix_random_2 <- array_final[,,2]

# Add the matrices.
result_add <- matrix_random_1 + matrix_random_2
print(result_add)

```

##### Matrix Multiplication and Element-wise Multiplication of Matrices

Element wise product of the two matrices A and B is given by `A*B`. Matrix multiplication between two matrices A and B is given by `A%*%B`.

**TO-DO**

    1) Find the elementwise product of two matrices, and also perform matrix multiplication between the two matrices. Also, the 2 matrices must *not* be square matrices.
    
    2) Randomize the matrices. (*NOTE*: The matrix multiplication rules must be taken into account before initializing the matrices)
    
The code chunk given below will provide some help for the above tasks.

```{r}

# Initializing matrices.
matrix_3 = matrix(c(1:9), 3, 3)

matrix_4 = matrix(c(2*1:9), 3, 3)

# Element-wise multiplication of the 2 matrices.
matrix_3 * matrix_4

# Matrix multiplication of the 2 matrices.
matrix_3 %*% matrix_4

```

##### Inverse of and Transpose of a Matrix 

The purpose of the inverse of the matrix is to help aid simultaneous solving of multiple algebraic linear equations. 

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing its rows into columns and its columns into rows. 

We use the `solve()` function for evaluating the inverse of a matrix and the `t()` function for evaluating the transpose of the matrix.

**MINI-TASK:** Check if one can find out the inverse of a non-square matrix and if you can try to print out the inverse for the matrix `non_square` in the code chunk given below. (The library `MASS` may be of some use!)

```{r}

random_matrix = matrix(c(sample(1:9)), 3, 3)

inverse_matrix = solve(random_matrix)

transpose_matrix = t(random_matrix)

#Initializing mini-task matrix.

non_square = matrix(c(sample(1:6)), 2, 3)

```

##### Rank of a Matrix


Rank of a matrix refers to the number of linearly independent rows or columns of the matrix. (Linearly Independent and The rank of the matrix can be found using the `rank()` function.


**TO-DO**

Deduce the output of the below code chunk before running it yourself and then try to find the rank of the matrix. (Try to find out what the `byrow` attribute is responsible for!)

```{r}

matrix_1 = matrix(c(1,2,3,2,4,6,1,0,0),ncol=3,byrow=FALSE)

```

### Eigen Values and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues of a matrix can be identified using the equation |A - λI| = 0 where I refers to the identity matrix of the same order as that of A.

The function `eigen()` calculates the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix. The result of this function is a list of two components named `values` and `vectors`.

**MINI-TASK:** Find out the use for the `$` operator in the code chunk given below.

```{r}
A = matrix(c(8,7,2,3),2,2,byrow=TRUE)

eigen_list = eigen(A)

eigenvalues = eigen_list$values
eigenvectors = eigen_list$vectors

print(eigenvalues)
print(eigenvectors)
```

### Singular value decomposition (SVD)

Singular Value Decomposition is a technique used in Machine Learning and is used to make sense out of data that is noisy. It represents a dataset by eliminating the less important parts and generating an accurate approximation of the original dataset.

SVD will take a matrix as an input and decompose it into a product of three simpler matrices. The below image depicts the clear decomposition of a matrix into 3 separate matrices. SVD finds a lot of use in the world of **Natural Language Processing**.

![](./images/SVD.png)

The function `svd()` takes an arbitrary matrix argument and calculates the singular value decomposition of the matrix.

**TO-DO** 

    1) Try to obtain each matrix of the `svd_results` variable by using the `$` operator.
    
    2) Check the purpose of the `nu` and `nv` attributes of the `svd()` function via the R documentation.
    
    3) Try to print out each matrix that was obtained after decomposition using the `$` operator.
    
    4) OPTIONAL: A challenge would be to use the matrices that we have obtained via decomposition to verify whether SVD was accurate or not.

```{r}

matrix_svd = matrix(c(sample(1:100)), 10, 10)

svd_results = svd(matrix_svd, nu =5, nv = 5)

svd_results


```


### Solving linear equations simultaneously

In order to solve a set of linear equations, we require concepts such as the inverse of a matrix. Let us consider the following set of equations.

$$
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = b_1
$$
$$
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = b_2
$$
$$
a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = b_3
$$
The values *a* and *b* are constants. The values *x* are variables. These values can be represented in the form of matrices where the constants *a* are a part of the matrix A and the constants on the RHS *b* are a part of the matrix B. 

We can evaluate the variables in the solution via the following equations:

$$

AX = B

$$
$$

X = A^{-1}B

$$
**MINI-TASK**

Obtain the solution for 5 randomly generated linear equations using the same method.


```{r}

A_1 = c(2, 3, 5)
A_2 = c(5, 8, 3)
A_3 = c(4, 5, 1)

A = rbind(A_1, A_2, A_3)

B = matrix(c(15, 20, 21))

inverse_A = solve(A)

X = inverse_A %*% B

print(X)

```
