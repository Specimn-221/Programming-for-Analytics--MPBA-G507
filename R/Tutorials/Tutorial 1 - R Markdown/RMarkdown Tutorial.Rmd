## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.


### Getting Started

* You can render Microsoft PowerPoint presentations from R Markdown documents. 
* This capability is made possible by recent improvements to Pandoc, which converts files from one markup format into another. 
* To use all the features of RStudio with PowerPoint output, install the RStudio Preview which bundles Pandoc 2.x. 
* You should also install the development version of rmarkdown.

### Example

```
---
output: powerpoint_presentation
---
# Section Header
## Section Header 
### Title slide
Content
#### Content Header
##### Content Header
```

### Knit

* When you knit an R Markdown document, RStudio renders your document in the PowerPoint output format. 
* If you are using RStudio Desktop, your PowerPoint presentation will automatically open and take you back to the last slide you were viewing. 
* If you are using RStudio Server, you will be prompted to download the PowerPoint presentation file.

### Command Line

You can also render files programmatically from the R console.

```
rmarkdown::render("in.Rmd", output_format = "powerpoint_presentation")
```

### Modify by Hand

* In some cases, you might want to make manual adjustments to your PowerPoint presentation after you render it. 
* Fortunately, markdown elements – such as titles, text, code, and tables – are rendered natively in PowerPoint. 
* Manually changing the slide size or design after rendering will automatically change these elements to match the new style.

### Images and Tables

### Overview

* Images and tables will always be placed on new slides.
* The only elements that can coexist with an image or table on a slide are the slide header and caption.

# Images

### Images

* Images will be scaled automatically to fit the slide. 
* You can render images from file or from the web. 
* Captions will render below the image. 
* You can add a link to the caption or to the image itself.

### Examples

```
# image from file
![](file)
# image from web
![](URL)
# plain caption
![caption](image)
# linked caption
![[caption](link)](image)
# linked image
[![](image)](link)
```
# Tables

### Tables

Tables render natively in PowerPoint and pick up the style defined by the reference template.

```
 manufacturer    displ   hwy     class
-------------    ------  -----  ---------
        audi     1.8     29      compact
   chevrolet     5.3     20        suv
       dodge     2.4     24      minivan
Table: Simple table syntax and caption.
```

### Example

        audi     1.8     29      compact
   chevrolet     5.3     20        suv
       dodge     2.4     24      minivan

Table: Simple table syntax and caption.


### Columns and Notes

### Columns

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
You can use the the Two Content layout to put material in side by side columns. To use the Two Content layout, nest two div containers of class column inside one div container of class columns.
:::
::: {.column}
```
:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
contents...
:::
::: {.column}
contents...
:::
::::::
```
:::
::::::::::::::


### Notes

You can add speaker notes to slides. Speaker notes support limited formats such as bold, italics, and lists. Speaker notes, of course, will be available in handouts and in presenter view.

```
::: notes
This is a speaker note.
- Use basic Markdown
- like this list
- *and inline formatting*
:::
```

### Templates

### Overview

The size and design of PowerPoint presentations are determined by the reference template. 
```
---
output: 
  powerpoint_presentation:
    reference_doc: template.pptx
---
```

The default PowerPoint template contains a blank presentation in the standard (4:3) size. 


# Layouts

### Details

Any template included with a recent install of PowerPoint (either with `.pptx` or `.potx` extension) should work, as will most templates derived from these. The template should contain the following four layouts:

1. Title
2. Section Header
3. Title and Content
4. Two Content

### 1. Title 

* This layout has a placeholder for a title and a placeholder for a subtitle.
* This layout is used when you specify a title in the YAML header.

```
---
title: My presentation
---
```

### 2. Section Header

* This layout has a single placeholder for a section header
* Content will not render on this layout.
* This layout is used when you specify section headers above the slide level.

```
# Section Header
```

### 3. Title and Content

* This layout has a placeholder for a title and a single placeholder for content.
* This layout is used for content slides specified at the slide level.

```
### Title
and content
```

### 4. Two Content

* This layout has a placeholder for a title and two placeholders for content. 
* This layout is used when you specify two columns for a content slides at the slide level.

```
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
contents...
:::
::: {.column}
contents...
:::
::::::::::::::
```

### Structuring the Presentation

### Markdown Headers

You can structure your presentation with section and content slides using a hierarchy of markdown headers. 

```
# Level 1
## Level 2
### Level 3
```

### Slide Level

The slide level is the header level that creates content slides from the Title and Content or Two Content layouts. Your R Markdown document is carved up into slides according to rules.

### Rules

* Headers at the slide level always starts a new slide
* Headers above the slide level in the hierarchy create section headers
* Headers below the slide level in the hierarchy create headers within a slide
* A horizontal rule always starts a new slide
* A title page is constructed automatically from the document’s title block

### Setting the Slide Level

In order to structure a PowerPoint presentation, Pandoc needs to determine which header level should be used for the slide level. 

**By default, Pandoc sets the slide level to the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content somewhere in the document.**

# Examples

### Slide Level: 3

```
---
output:
  powerpoint_presentation:
    slide_level: 3
---
# Section header (First slide)
## Section header (Second slide)
### Title (Third slide)
Content (this sets the default slide level)
#### Content header (Third slide)
##### Content header (Third slide)
```

### Slide Level: 1

If you do not want to structure your slides into sections, you can just use level 1 headers to create all your slides.

```
---
output: powerpoint_presentation
---
# Slide 1
Content
# Slide 2
Content
```
